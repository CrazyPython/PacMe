####Richard Jones' talk at US PyCon 2012

It has inspired me to fiddle around with pygame and it also covers many useful tools, so check out [the video](http://pyvideo.org/video/1718/introduction-to-pygame) and [the related repository](https://bitbucket.org/r1chardj0n3s/pygame-tutorial).
The tmx.py also comes from him enabling me to play around with Tiled-created map!
